Register ROIs,"In align mode, the register ROIs feature allows for the assignment of a common ``id`` property to overlapping ROI objects.  A clustering algorithm based on the Jaccard Index is used for tracking ROIs across imaging sessions.  Results can be manually edited using the *merge* and *unmerge* tools."
Propagate Tags,"In align mode, the propagate tags button distributes tags across ROI objects from different imaging datasets sharing the same ``id`` property.  The user can select which tags to propagate.  Thus, regions need only be tagged in one imaging_dataset, and these tags can be added to other recordings of the same region."
