Introduction
============
The ROI Buddy GUI can be used for viewing, creating, and editing the regions
of interest (ROIs) associated with a SIMA imaging dataset.  In addition it can
be used for registering ROIs from different imaging sessions of the same
field-of-view, allowing for the longitudinal tracking of cells in serial
imaging experiments.


Installation
============
The ROI Buddy GUI is compiled as a Windows executable (.exe) file and is 
available for download `here
<ftp://losonczylab.org/ROI_Buddy.zip>`_.

Alternatively, the ROI Buddy GUI can be built from sources.  Dependencies for
the ROI Buddy GUI are identical to those for the SIMA module.
